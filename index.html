            <p>Tired of cults that leave you hanging with their broken promises, indentured servitude, and ironically fractitious politics?</p>
            <p>Well, sorry, but that's how cults are. So why not join the largest, and therefore least humilitating?</p>
            <p>At OmniCult&trade;, we've streamlined the entire degradation and de-humanization process with the brutal efficiency that only a multi-billion, multi-national corporation can. From the moment you are sedated and wheeled into our de-programming chamber, you will feel like you've died and gone to Xenoth! But don't worry, that part comes later.</p>
